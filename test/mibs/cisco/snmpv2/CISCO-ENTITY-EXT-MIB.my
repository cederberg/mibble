        DESCRIPTION
		"This MIB is an extension of the ENTITY-MIB
		 specified in RFC2737.

		 This MIB module contains  Cisco-defined  extensions 
		 to the  entityPhysicalTable to represent infomation
		 related to entities of class module(entPhysicalClass
		 = 'module') which have a Processor.

                 A processor module is defined as a physical entity
                 that has a CPU, RAM and NVRAM  so that
                 it can independently
                    - load a bootable image
                    - save configuration.
		 This module is the entry point for external
		 applications like SNMP Manager, CLI, FTP etc.

		 Line card is an interface card	 with atleast a 
		 Processor and RAM. This might be referred to as 
		 Service Module in some cisco products.
		
		 A configuration register is  a 16 bit 
		 software register.
		 The configuration register is mainly used to 
		 check for instructions on where to find the Cisco 
		 Operating System software.
		 Some other functions of configuration register are:
		  - To select a boot source and default boot filename.
		  - To enable or disable the Break function.
		  - To control broadcast addresses.
		  - To set the console terminal baud rate.
		  - To load operating software from Flash memory.
		  - To allow us to manually boot the system using the 
		    boot command at the bootstrap program prompt.
		 
		 Booting is the process of initializing the
		 hardware and starting the Operating System."

ConfigRegisterValue ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

	STATUS       current
	DESCRIPTION
		"An Integer containing the value of config register.
		 
		 The definition of individual bits from left to right 
		 when set are as follows:
		
		 00 to	
		 03		Boot Fields(Refer below for
				explanation).

		 04 to 
		 05		Not Used.
		
		 06		Causes system software to ignore the 
				contents of NVRAM.

		 07		Enable the original equipment 
				manufacturer (OEM) bit.

		 08		The Break function is disabled.

		 09		Not used.

		 10		Broadcast based on 0.0.0.0 IP address.

		 11 to 
		 12		Defines the console baud rate as below:
				Bits 11 & 12 unset: 9600 baud(default),
				Bit 11 set & 12 unset: 4800 baud,
				Bit 11 unset & 12 set: 1200 baud,
				Bit 11 set & 12 set: 2400 baud

		 13		Boots default Flash software if 
				network boot fails.

		 14		IP broadcasts do not have network numbers.

		 15		Enables diagnostic messages and ignores 
				the contents of NVRAM.
      

		Meanings for different values of Boot Fields
		(Bits 00 to 03) are explained below:

		Value(in hex)	Description
		------------    -----------
		 00		On powerup or reload, the system
				remains at the ROM monitor prompt 
				(rommon>), awaiting a user command 
				to boot the system manually by means 
				of the rommon boot command.

		 01		On powerup or reload, the system loads
				the system image found in onboard 
				Flash memory.
	
		 02 to		On powerup or reload, the system loads
		 0F		the system image specified by 
				ceExtSysBootImageList.
				It tries to boot the
				image in the order in which 
				the image names are entered in 
				ceExtSysBootImageList. If 
				it cannot boot any image in the
				ceExtSysBootImageList, it 
				stays in ROM monitor mode."

BootImageList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This contains a list of  boot images, 
	     each separated by the ';' (semi-colon) character.  
	     The following provides a syntax for parsing a single
	     boot image list item.

             <device>:[filename] | <URL>

	     <device> can be (but not limited to):
		flash, bootflash, slot0, rom, C
	     The transfer protocol used in the <URL>
	     can be (but not limited to):
		 tftp, ftp, rcp, mop.

	     The following is en example containing two boot image
	     names:  
		disk0:c7100-ik2s-mz;tftp://dirt/c7100-ik2s-mz
     				
	     If the filename is not  specified, then the
	     first file on the <device> will be used.

   	     If the last two characters in the returned value
	     are ';+' this indicates that additional boot image
	     items are configured on the device but can not
	     be returned because the maximum string size limitation
	     would be exceeded.

	     For example:
		disk0:image1;disk0:image2;+
