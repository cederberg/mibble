-- This MIB displays memory and CPU utilization on cisco devices. CPU 
-- utilization will give a general idea of how busy the processor is. 
-- The numbers are a ratio of the current idle time over the longest 
-- idle time. Please note that this information should be used as an 
-- estimate only.
