--    This module manages Cisco's intercept feature. 
--    This MIB replaces CISCO-TAP-MIB. This MIB defines 
--    a generic stream table that contains fields common to 
--    all intercept types. Specific intercept filters are 
--    defined in extension MIBs. They are CISCO-IP-TAP-MIB 
--    for IP intercepts, CISCO-802-TAP-MIB for IEEE 802 
--    intercepts and CISCO-USER-CONNECTION-TAP-MIB for 
--    RADIUS-based user connection intercepts.

--  RevDescr
--    Added a new type to cTap2StreamType for intercepting 
--    sessions/flows of Mobile subscribers in wireless CDMA 
--    technology. Specific intercept filter is defined in 
--    CISCO-CDMA-PDSN-TAP-MIB.

        is a small subset of the traffic that could be intercepted. 
        
        
        The Table consists of generic fields that are independent

        filter specification. 
        
        Note that the Mediation Device must make sure there is  
        only one type of specific filter created with the same  
        indices as that of a row in this table, otherwise the  
        later creations will fail. For example, if there is a
