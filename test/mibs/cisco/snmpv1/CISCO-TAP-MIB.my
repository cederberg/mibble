    ACCESS not-accessible

    DESCRIPTION
        "The Intercept Stream IP Table lists the IPv4 and IPv6 streams
        to be intercepted.  The same data stream may be required by
        multiple taps, and one might assume that often the intercepted
        stream is a small subset of the traffic that could be
        intercepted.
        
        This essentially provides options for packet selection, only
        some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or
        from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would
        configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card
        everything else.  If all traffic to or from a given IP Address
        is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries
        listing the IP Address as source and destination respectively,
        and wild-card everything else.  If a particular voice on a
        teleconference is to be intercepted, on the other hand, one
        would extract the multicast (destination) IP address, the
        source IP Address, the protocol (UDP), and the source and
        destination ports from the call control exchange and list all
        necessary information.
        
        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
        intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index
        permits multiple classifiers to be used together, such as
        having an IP address as source or destination. "

        This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts
        placed elsewhere than a subscriber interface.

        some of which might be used. For example, if all traffic to or
        from a given interface is to be intercepted, one would
        configure an entry which lists the interface, and wild-card
        everything else.  If all traffic to or from a given MAC Address
        is to be intercepted, one would configure two such entries
        listing the MAC Address as source and destination respectively,
        and wild-card everything else.
        
        The first index indicates which Mediation Device the
        intercepted traffic will be diverted to. The second index

        This is most useful on non-routing platforms or on intercepts

        If the value is -1, one or both of

    DESCRIPTION
        "When there is intervention needed due to some events related
        to entries configured in cTapStreamIpTable, the device
        notifies the manager of the event.
        
        This notification may be generated in conjunction with the
        intercept application, which is designed to expect the
        notification to be sent as reliably as possible, e.g., through
        the use of a finite number of retransmissions until
        acknowledged, as and when such mechanisms are available; for
        example, with SNMPv3, this would be an InformRequest."
