--    A Layer 1 address which includes the hardware address
--     space as well as the usual MAC address. This object is
--     encoded in ASCII as
--                <type>,<length>,<address>
--        where
--                <type>  is the value of the hardware address space
--                        field, as used in ARP (i.e, 1 for Ethernet,
--                        6 for token ring...)  IANA has a list of
--                        registered numbers for this field.
--                <length> is the length of the address, in bytes (not
--                         ASCII chars)
--                <address> is the ASCII hex-encoded address (2 ASCII
--                         characters per byte; 12 chars for an Ethernet
--                         address.)
--        This encoding is intended to mirror the representation
--        of MAC addresses in DHCP.
